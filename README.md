# Dog-Tinder-Codestuff
Project for Human Factors of Computing Systems class

## Running this project

The app is best experienced through the Web build using an Android phone.

### Web build

If you are the professor of the class this is for, you should have recieved a link where the app is being hosted. It is being hosted on one of the group member's student webpage which we did not want to list publicly for privacy reasons.

The web build is best viewed on an Android phone. Apple phones can view the page, but currently they cannot interact with input text fields. The web build does work on desktop although the project was designed around mobile usage so certain systems might not look or function intuitively on desktop.

## Android build

Download the Datez4Dogz.apk file from the Android release on to your phone. On mobile, releases can be found towards the bottom of the github repository. This is the installer for the app. Run this file to install the app on your phone. Datez 4 Dogz should then appear as an app on your phone. You should be able to delete the app from your phone the same way you would delete any other app.

NOTE: text size settings do not work on the android build
