# Dog-Tinder-Codestuff
Project for Human Factors of Computing Systems class

## Getting Started
### Install Git
Install git if you do not have it already https://git-scm.com/downloads. 

To see if you have git installed, run the following command in command line:

    git --version
    

If the terminal says that git is not recognized, you do not have git installed.

Once you have git installed, you will now be able to open Git Bash in a specific directory by right-clicking in that directory and selecting the "Open Git Bash here" option.

The file GIT_COMMANDS.md contains information about git commands you will likely use throughout this project.

### Development

At the top of github, you should see an "Issues" tab. Issues with the "Scene" label will tell you about specific scenes that we need to create. You can click on an issue to see more about that specific scene. In the top right, you should see a section called "Assignees". If no one is listed there and you want to work on that scene, you can click "assign yourself" to claim the scene. Having us each work on separate scenes will help minimize merge conflicts. You can create other scenes to assist in the creation of your scene, just don't modify other people's scenes. 

When you start working on a new scene, create a new branch for that scene and develop the scene in that branch. When you are done creating that scene, open a pull request for your branch.
To create a pull request, go to github, navigate to your branch, click on the contribute button, and then click "Open pull request". 

Other notes:

- DO NOT PUSH THINGS TO MAIN

- When adding new files to the project, please place them in the appropriate folder.

- If you are adding text, use one of the themes found in the Themes folder. This will allow us to do stuff like change font size for all text really easily.

- The Globals folder contains scripts that can be accessed from anywhere and contains data that will persist through scene changes. You might want to look at it to see what is available.
